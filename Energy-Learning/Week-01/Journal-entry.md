Summary of RENEWABLE ENERGY By George Boyle Chapter 1.
Chapter 1: INTRODUCING RENEWABLE ENERGY
Basic energy terms, types,the two laws of thermodynamics, energy conversions.
Definition of renewable energy.
Climate change, greenhouse effect
renewable energy sources: basically the sun, which all other renewable energy are gotten from.
There are two non-solar renewable energy: tidal energy and geothermal energy.

Chapter 2: SOLAR THERMAL ENERGY
The sun is the source of all forms of energy
The rooftop solar water heater has two types:The pumped solar water heater, The thermosyphon solar water heater.
The nature and availability of solar radiation: has do with wavelengths of solar radiation, diffuse radiation is through clouds while direct is withouth clouds.Availability of solar radiation.Tilt and orientation refers to how the solar panels are being placed so as to trap radiation.
The magic of glass is how glass is made, the transperency of it, the mechanisms of heat loss through the glass and how to reduce itwhich are convection,conduction and radiation, U-VALUE ETC.
Applying Low-temperature solar energy applications to Domestic water heating, Domestic space heating.passive solar heating is really about the subtle influence of climate on building design.(a)Conservatory,(b) Trombe Wall, (c) Direct gain. The different Varieties of solar heating system.
Active solar heating
History: appeared in the 1890s, patented in 1909 by William J. Bailey in California. 
Solar collectors: Unglazed panels, flat water collectors, flat air collectors, evacuated tube collectors, line focus collectors, and point focus collectors.
Robustness, mounting and orientation: mounted on the roof.They must be firmly attached to the roof in a leak-proof manner and then must withstand everything that nature can throw at them - frost, wind, acid rain, sea spray and hailstones. They also have to be proof against internal corrosion and very large temperature swings.
